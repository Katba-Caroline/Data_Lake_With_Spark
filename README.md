# Project Description
A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their data their data warehouse to a data lake.
Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs 
in their app.

## Sparkify would like a Data Engineer to build an ETL pipeline that does the following:
    - Extracts their data from S3
    - Processes them using Spark
    - Loads the data back into S3 as a set of dimensional tables
    - Continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to. 
## Project Datasets
The two datasets reside in S3. 

**Song Dataset**

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID.

For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset

    - song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
    - song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

     {"num_songs": 1,
     "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7",
     '"artist_latitude": null,
     "artist_longitude": null,
     "artist_location": "",
     "artist_name": "Line Renaud",
     "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1",
     "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff",
     "duration": 152.92036,
     "year": 0}

**Log Dataset**
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above.These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings. The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month.

For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

     - log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
     - log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

## Database schema design

**Staging Tables**
 - staging_events
 - staging_songs

**Fact Table**
  - songplays - records in event data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
      - *songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent*

**Dimension Tables**
  - songs - songs in music database
      - *song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration*
  - artists - artists in music database 
      - *artist_id, name, location, lattitude, longitude*
  - users - All app users
    - *user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level*
  - time - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units 
      - *start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday*


# Project structure
This project includes the following script files:
  - *etl.py*: reads data from S3, processes that data using Spark, and writes them back to S3.
  - *dl.cfg*:contains your AWS credentials.

# Steps to Run
To run this project you will need to fill the following information, and save it as dwh.cfg in the project root folder.
      [AWS]
      AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID= 
      AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY= 

Run run the etl script to extract data from the files in S3, processes them using Spark, and store it in the dimensional tables.
    
    python etl.py
